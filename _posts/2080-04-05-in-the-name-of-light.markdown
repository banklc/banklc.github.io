> 2014.12 - 斯特拉斯堡, 法國 - Strasbourg, France 🇫🇷

<p style='text-align: justify;'>斯特拉斯堡真的是一个特别神奇的城市，坐落在阿尔萨斯-洛林大区，左手法国，右手德国，自古以来就是兵家必争之地，几经易主，最终加入法兰西共和国。它是著名的圣诞之都 (法语：Capitale de Noël)，圣诞期间整个城市都会装饰成为童话般的圣诞世界。2014年，刚刚去法国留学的第一个平安夜，就是在风雪中从卢森堡抵达了斯特拉斯堡。斯特拉斯堡的火车站很有特色，旧的火车站镶嵌在一个现代的玻璃外壳内，颇具时代沧桑感。夜幕降临之后，整个城市便是灯光如昼，街上的彩色霓虹十分绚丽，拿出相机就咔嚓定格了这一画面。</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>从此，「光」便是我生命不可或缺的一部分。夕阳西下的暮光，日出时分的晨光，一路向北的极光，以及同步光源的X光，都是我所热爱的，追逐的，光芒。科学和艺术大概是两座高峰，但当你有幸登上其中一座，你大概会发现，那笼罩在周围的，是哲学的迷雾。我期待在瑞士光源的日夜中用X光揭开微观世界的重重谜题，我也期待拿起手中的相机用可见光记录下大千世界的波澜壮阔。我更期待黑夜过去，地平线上我就是那道「光」。</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Strasbourg is a particularly magical city for me. It is located in the Alsace-Lorraine region with left-hand towards France and right-hand towards Germany. It has been a battleground for the military since ancient times between these two countries. After several changes of regime, eventually it joined the French Republic. Being famous in the name of Christmas Capital (French: Capitale de Noël), the whole city will be decorated into a fairytale world during Christmas. In 2014, the first Christmas Eve spent in France, I arrived in Strasbourg from Luxembourg with heavy snow everywhere. The train station in Strasbourg is very special, as the old railway station is set in a modern glass enclosure, which is quite a feeling of vicissitudes. After the sunset came to the darkness, the city is lighnted by color neon on the streets. The moment I pressed the camera shutter, the photo freezed as you see now.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Since then, »light« has been an indispensable part of my life. The twilight of the sunset, the dawn light at sunrise, the aurora all the way to the north, and the X-ray of the synchrotron light source are all my brilliant, chasing, and shining light. Science and art are probably two summits of human society, but if you are lucky enough to be on the top of one of them, you will probably realise that it is the fog of philosophy that surrounds you. Encouraged to use brilliant X-rays to uncover the mysteries of the microcosm during the day and night at Swiss light source, also passionated to use the camera in hand to record the vastness of the world using the visible light, I am more looking forward to the dissipation of endless dark night, and I wish to be the first »light« on the horizon. </p>
